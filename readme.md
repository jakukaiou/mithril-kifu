# Typescript and Sass Webpack Boilerplate

A simple webpack boilerplate for front end projects using Typescript/Sass

## Building & Dev Server
1. Install node and npm. The 6.x release is preferred.

2. Clone the repository

3. `npm install` to install dependencies

4. `npm run build` will build your js/css into `build/`

5. `npm start` or `npm run server` then go to `localhost:8080` to use webpack dev server with hot module replacement
